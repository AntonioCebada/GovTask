### Analysis Summary

I can help you create a map of the navigation flow. To do this effectively, I need to understand the scope of your request. Please clarify:

1.  **What specific part of the codebase are you interested in?** For example, are you looking for the navigation flow of a web application, a mobile app, or a specific module within a larger system?
2.  **What level of detail do you require?**
    *   **High-level:** Just the main screens/pages and their primary transitions.
    *   **Mid-level:** Include major user actions that trigger navigation, like button clicks or form submissions.
    *   **Low-level:** Detailed function calls or code snippets related to navigation events.

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can use my tools to gather the relevant information and generate a comprehensive map.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Need for Clarification**
   The current report indicates that more information is needed from the user to generate a navigation flow map. The system is asking for clarification on the specific part of the codebase of interest (e.g., web application, mobile app, or a specific module) and the desired level of detail (high-level, mid-level, or low-level).
